Research Experience
Haas Business School Berkeley, CA
Research Assistant January 2019 - May 2019
• Recovered the effect of stress shocks from the 2008 financial crisis on CEO’s aging with the use of differences-in-differences analysis, including
the experience of the financial crisis as a dummy variable to control for individual differences and retrieve the impact of stress shocks
• Suggested the use of panel data to isolate the influence of time-invariant variables as confounding variables and implemented them with a
longitudinal data set; avoided the potential covariation between effort invested in visual image and experienced stress by controlling for time-
invariant factors for each data point
