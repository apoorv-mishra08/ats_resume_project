WORK EXPERIENCE
Ping An Technology Shanghai, CN
Algorithm Engineer Intern, Knowledge Graph Team Oct 2020–Nov 2020
• Built a pool of selective stocks based on analyst recommendations and rankings from 2015 to 2019; combined fundamental
and technical factors to create a strategy achieving 26.5% annual return and 12.5% maximum drawdown
• Authored model documentation for 30+ firm indicators, patterns, and signals for investments
• Provided the firm with an established and systematic backtesting library using OOP in C++ to save over 95% of time
Kaifeng Investment Management Shenzhen, CN
Quantitative Research Intern, Quantitative Trading Department Apr 2020–Aug 2020
• Created models based on hedging behavior of stock index futures and applied basis adjusted price-volume features to trading
stock index futures using regression analysis, achieving an information coefficient (IC) of over 0.08
• Analyzed and interpreted high-frequency data from the SSE Science and Technology Innovation Board (STAR) using Principal
component analysis (PCA); discovered the significant intraday reversal effect of STAR market stocks
• Developed and submitted 15+ market-neutral alphas with excellent performance; the alphas traded on the live market and
achieved top 10% performance within the whole alpha pool
Shanghai Luoshu Investment Shanghai, CN
Quantitative Research Intern, Division of Investment and Research Jan 2020–Mar 2020
• Identified statistically significant alphas in index futures overnight trading; spearheaded a team of interns to construct a factor
model to obtain stronger alphas on index futures using Python
• Applied machine learning techniques, including LASSO regression, ridge regression, decision tree, logistic regression, neural
networks, and other models to predict overnight returns and evaluated factor performance
• Implemented backtesting programs to calculate the Sharpe ratio, profit over turnover and other indicators; developed daily
adjustment strategies with a Sharpe ratio above 3 and profit margin above 6.5 bps
RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
An Empirical Analysis of the Barillas-Shanken Six-Factor Asset Pricing Model in Chinese A-Share Market Shanghai, CN
Research Assistant, Advisor: Professor Hongfei Zhu, Fudan University Apr 2021–Present
• Studied the efficiency of Barillas-Shanken asset pricing factors including SMB, HML, and ROE using the Fama–MacBeth
regression in R, compared the explaining effect of the cross-sectional return difference in stocks with other asset pricing models
• Enhanced factor performance based on research of economic and financial interpretations in Fama and French (2016) etc.
SSE 50ETF Option Implied Volatility Surface: Analysis of Stochastic Local Volatility Model Shanghai, CN
Research Assistant, Advisor: Professor Xianglin Jiang, Fudan University Oct 2020–May 2021
• Calibrated a stochastic local volatility model (SLV) to price the SSE 50 ETF option using the finite difference method and
Monte Carlo simulation; predicted implied volatility of the SSE 50 ETF option
• Built SSE 50 ETF option hedging strategy using SLV-projected delta; reduced hedging error by over 30% compared to the
Heston stochastic volatility model in regard to Root Mean Square Error
