WORK EXPERIENCE
Vanguard Malvern, PA
Quantitative Research Intern, Quantitative Equity Group (Equity Alpha Strategies) 06/2020 – 08/2020
• Conducted a research project on seeking alpha strategies using machine learning techniques with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn and
statistical techniques such as ad-hoc signal regularization and industry contextualization and neutralization for signal noise reduction
and financial forecasting with nonparametric panel dataset
• Explored and built unstructured and non-linear multi-factor equity forecasting frameworks to identify potential complements to
traditional linear-structured models commonly used in quantitative equity investment space
• Experimented with various signal filtering and processing techniques and performed neural network architecture design,
hyperparameter optimizations, fixed-window and extending-window rolling training, software optimizations, out-of-sample and in-
sample backtesting on long/short portfolios constructed by models which outperformed the linear benchmark model
